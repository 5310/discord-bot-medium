  ` @medium help
  
  ` @medium list
    Lists all added channelings with their priority indices
    
  ` @medium add <name> <regex> <microservice-url>
    Adds a new channeling at the highest priority index
    Admin-only
    
  ` @medium remove <index>
    Admin-only
    
  ` @medium move <src-index> <dest-index>
    Removes the source channeling and places it just before the destination channeling
      Adjust indices afterwards, ofc
      If given an index that does not exist for source, does nothing
      If given an index that does not exist for destination, snaps to the next sensible value
    Admin-only
    
  ` @medium export
    Dumps the Guild's config to a JSON attachment
    Admin-only
    
  ` @medium import <attachment>
    Tries to replace the server's config with the given JSON attachment
    Admin-only
    
  ` @medium sustain
    Keeps a Thread alive forever!
    
  ` @medium repose
    Lets a Thread die-off naturally
    
  ` @medium *
    Any other leading command is checked against channelings like regular posts
      This circumvents any collisions with other bots
      Ofc, if none match, tells you to get `help`
    
  ` *
    For every new message it can read in a channel it's allowed to post in
      If the content matches any channeling's regex in order of priority 
        Send's it to is microservice
        ? Add a temporary reaction to signify it's processing it
        Delegates the response as a reply
  ? What about aliases?
    Local ones, ofc, can't trigger other bots
  ? Formalize Mediumâ€“Specter interface
